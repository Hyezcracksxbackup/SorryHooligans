    <h1> Sorry Hooligans </h1>
    <p>Dear Hooligans,

I just wanted to take a moment to say sorry — genuinely.

If I’ve been acting out of line, or saying things that felt disrespectful, that was never my intention. Maybe I took some things too far, maybe I tried to be funny when it wasn’t the right time.

I know things got heated sometimes in the group, and I might’ve crossed a line. I'm not perfect, but I’m trying to be better. This message isn’t to stir anything up — it’s just to say I respect you all, even if we’ve clashed.

No hard feelings from my side. We’re all here trying to have fun in our own way.

Respectfully,  
Hyex
</p>
